# Practice Projects

This repository is a personal space where I save files and small projects I work on to sharpen my skills.

## Purpose

- Improve my coding skills through regular practice.
- Experiment with different tools, libraries, and frameworks.
- Track my learning progress over time.

## Notes

These files are mainly for learning and experimentation. They may not always follow best practices or be fully optimized â€” the goal is continuous growth and improvement.
